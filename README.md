## A. Overview

jamblr is an iOS app built on React Native that gives you song recommendations,
which you can swipe left or right on. If you swipe right on a song, you'll get
more songs like it. When you're done, you can export your songs to a Spotify
playlist!

## B. Implementation

jamblr is built using React Native, and it uses Spotify's iOS SDK to connect
to the user's Spotify account.
